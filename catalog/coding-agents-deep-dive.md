## 🛡️ Best Practices & Patterns

### The Coding Agent Workflow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Requirements] --> B[Plan]
    B --> C[Code]
    C --> D[Test]
    D --> E[Review]
    E --> F{Pass?}
    F -->|No| B
    F -->|Yes| G[Deploy]
```

### 1. **Plan → Edit → Test → Review Loop**
- Always start with clear, testable requirements
- Break complex tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
- Include automated testing in the workflow
- Review generated code before production use

### 2. **Safety & Security Patterns**
```python
# Example: Restricted file scope pattern
ALLOWED_PATHS = ["/project/src", "/project/tests"]
READ_ONLY_PATHS = ["/project/config"]

def validate_file_access(path):
    if not any(path.startswith(allowed) for allowed in ALLOWED_PATHS):
        raise SecurityError(f"Access denied: {path}")
```

### 3. **Observability & Monitoring**
- Log all code changes with timestamps
- Track token usage and costs
- Monitor test pass rates
- Record user feedback and iterations

### 4. **Environment Management**
```yaml
# Docker Compose example
version: '3.8'
services:
  coding-agent:
    image: coding-agent:latest
    volumes:
      - ./code:/workspace:rw
      - ./tests:/tests:ro
    environment:
      - SANDBOX_MODE=true
      - MAX_TOKENS=10000
```
