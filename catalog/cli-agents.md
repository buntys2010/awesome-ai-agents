# ðŸ’» CLI & Terminal Agents

Developer-focused agents that operate in the shell to automate workflows, generate code, and manage systems.

## Why it matters
- Integrates naturally into developer workflows (CI/CD, DevOps, data)
- Works in restricted environments without GUIs
- Enables reproducible automations with low overhead

## Patterns
- Command planner â†’ executor â†’ verifier loop
- Idempotent scripts and dry-runs for safety
- Secrets handling: env vars, vaults
- Telemetry: command logs, exit codes, diffs

---

## Security & Governance
- Principle of least privilege (scoped creds, roles)
- Read-only defaults; explicit elevation gates
- Audit trails: full command history, redaction

---

## Examples to Add (Roadmap)
- Infra provisioning (Terraform plan/apply with review)
- Release automation (changelogs, tagging, publishing)
- Data pipelines (extract/transform/load with checkpoints)

Contributions welcome: add more CLI agents, patterns, and real-world recipes.
